The experience was rather pleasant\nand really well organized. Everybody at the center was super enthusiastic, helpful and some even wished\nme good luck. To a certain extent the center seemed a bit overstaffed, as at every corner somebody would tell\nyou where to go or sit down, but better this way then a completely disorganized vaccination campaign.</p>\n\n<p>The process at the center can broadly be described in the following steps:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>waiting</li>\n  <li>personal information checking</li>\n  <li>waiting</li>\n  <li>actual vaccination</li>\n  <li>waiting (for possible immediate side effects like an allergic reaction)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The best parts and the ones that will get programmers the most excited were the first 2 waiting periods.\nImagine a circular chair arrangement (the chairs were not actually arranged in a cycle, but the\nconcept remains the same). A person arrives and you place him/her at some random chair in the cycle. The\nnext person arrives and you place him/her to the right of the first person and so on … When a person\nhas to leave for the next stage of the process, you just take out the first person you\nplaced in the cycle of chairs, thereby growing the hole of empty chairs between the last and the first person who arrived\nin the buffer, eh cycle of chairs. They were essentially using, as computer scientists would call it,\na <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer\">ring buffer</a> for people. The nice bit about this\nprocedure is that you never have to make people change chairs or move while waiting.</p>\n\n<p>Once you were vaccinated you got placed in one of 6 rows, which where numbered 0 to 50 in increments\nof 10. The increments indicated when you could leave in the ongoing or next hour. Vaccinated people\nmight have to wait a different amount of time based on whether having received their first or second shot.\nHere the CS analogy is less obvious, but it could be seen as a sort of streamed\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_sort\">bucket sort</a> with scheduled flushes of buckets.</p>\n\n<p>A friend of mine told me afterwards that “it wasn’t surprising that me, the <em>proceduralo</em>,\nwould love the organization” at the center. While leaving I was thinking that this country\ncan still do some stuff really great and efficiently. I was definitely hyped for the rest of the day.</p>\n\n  </div>\n  \n</div>\n\n<div class=\"pagination\">\n  \n    <a class=\"pagination-item older\" href=\"/page2/\">Older</a>\n  \n  \n    <span class=\"pagination-item newer\">Newer</span>\n  \n</div>\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n      <div class=\"footer\">\n        <p>\n          &copy; 2021.
